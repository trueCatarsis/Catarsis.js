# Catarsis.js
Hello everyone! I am a VERY novice JavaScript programmer. In fact, I have nothing but an inexhaustible interest in this profession. However, I want to seriously tackle the code, as well as upgrade my English. I hope that I can soak up your experience and create the application of my dreams! Translator to help =)
